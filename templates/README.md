# OpeNPDN: Templates Directory

This directory contains the resistive networks network structures of the
user-defined tempaltes generated by the [create_template.py](src/create_template.py) script.

The .npz files are python objects that represent the conductivity matrix *G* of eeach template.
They are stored during training to enable a faster inference flow.
